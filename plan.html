<h1>Goals </h1>
<p> <div>The website is intended to promote Volleyball services offered at Slammers Beach and to improve their customers by at least 50% (i.e more than 150 players per week). Some of the services offered include professional volleyball competitions, a licenced bar, and other rental areas available for fun/fitness. The site also intends to bring awareness on Slammers Beach Volleyball and to encourage youths (15-30 years old)to come play. In order to be able to join the competition,people should register their teams online. </div></p>
<h2> Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>
    <div> Since we already know how many players we receive per week (100 people), the success of the site will be evaluated by counting the number of people who attend games per week. If the number is greater than 150, then the site will be doing its job. Otherwise, some other measures would have to be taken. Additionally, the site's success could be evaluated from recording the age of the players registered, in order to see if the players are within the targeted age range</div>
</p>
<h3> Target Audience</h3>
<p> <div> The taget audience in this case is the High School students or anyone between the age of 15 and 30</div></p>
<p> <div> Since most High School students would be still exploring their interest/passion,the site should be designed so that it encourages them to try new things such as playing Volleyball even if it would be for the first time.</div>
This in turn will be accomplished by portraying Volleyball as a great sport with many health benefits and by using appealing motto and images to the audience</p>
